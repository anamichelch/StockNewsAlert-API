# StockNewsAlert-API
I created this program Using Python.
-You get an alert message on your phone through SMS using Twilio
When the stock of the chosen company in this case TESLA changes up or down on value
It uses two APIs, to get stock informmation on price, then we calculate the Delta on stock price
And a News API to get the latest news on the company , we get the main description of API through Json

You will get an alert like this: 
TSLA: ðŸ”º2%
Headline: Were Hedge Funds Right About Piling Into Tesla Inc. (TSLA)?. 
Brief: We at Insider Monkey have gone over 821 13F filings that hedge funds and prominent investors are required to file by the SEC The 13F filings show the funds' and investors' portfolio positions as of March 31st, near the height of the coronavirus market crash
